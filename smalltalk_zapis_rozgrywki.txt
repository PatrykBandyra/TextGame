Hello traveler! My name is Kathri and I am a commander chief of Eosian Space Program. I am glad to finally meet you. I was told that you had the highest grades in y
our year at Space Academy. That is really impressive. As such, you are the only suitable person for our newest mission. We received a strange signal from deep space
. Our greatest scientists analyzed and concluded it could be connected with the origin of our species. I think you understand the importance of finding the source o
f that signal. We could learn the true nature of our origin. Your mission is to explore the space and reach the place where the signal came from. Explore, find new 
technology. Maybe you would even meet someone that will help you. I wish you good luck in your journey!

> speak Phelly
Hello! I am Phelly Perry from Eosian ATF bureau and I wish you good luck in your adventure. I have something less official to tell you. Listen… We recently captured
 a smuggler on our outer frontier and he was in possession of something you may find very helpful. Look, I do you a favor  and maybe one day you will be able to rep
ay me in one way or another, ha, ha. So I have a schema of Deflective Shield for you. You need Nanoparticle Coolant and Gold-Plated Microchip in order to create it.

Hi! Are you from Eo? Yes? So cool, I have half of my family there. My name is Hardy. I call myself an adventurer, although I have never been outside of our solar sy
stem. Well… But you know what? Maybe you will help me out in my escape from this galaxy? I am so hungry for travel which I cannot afford. You are really trying to b
uild this superb spaceship? So cool!!! I can even help you! I know about the Hyperdrive schema - I was an engineer… Before they threw me out of my company and took 
all the titles. So... You need a Reinforced Steel and Electromagnetic Generator. I have one more hint for you. If you were in need of a Gold-Plated Microchip, you w
ould have to go to Fates where they have a small factory of these rare components.

Welcome to Fates. Even though there are not many of us, we still were able to hold those barbarians from Hecate off of our precious resources. It is just informatio

 goodwill, we are going to share with you our schema for Hyperdrive. Listen carefully. In order to construct this advanced piece of equipment, you need to obtain Re
inforced Steel and Electromagnetic Generator. Good luck in your search!

 a small fortune. Unfortunately, I cannot afford them. If I had, I would not live on this deserted planet, ehhh…
