?- talk(kathri).
Hello traveler! My name is Kathri and I am a commander chief of Eosian Space Program. I'm glad to finally meet you. I was told that you had the highest grades in your year at Space Academy. That is really impressive. 
As such, you are the only suitable person for our newest mission. We received a strange signal from deep space. Our greatest scientists analyzed and concluded it could be connected with the origin of our species. I th
ink you understand the importance of finding the source of that signal. We could learn the true nature of our origin. Your mission is to explore the space and reach the place where the signal came from. Explore, find 
new technology and maybe you would even meet someone that will help you. I wish you good luck in your journey!

true.

?- talk(phelly).
Hello! I am Phelly Perry from Eosian ATF bureau and I wish you good luck in your adventure. I have something less official to tell you. Listen… We recently captured a smuggler on our outer frontier and he was in posse
ssion of something you may find very helpful. Look, I do you a favor  and maybe one day you will be able to repay me in one way or another, ha, ha. So I have a schema of Deflective Shield for you. You need Nanoparticl
e Coolant and Gold-Plated Microchip in order to create it.

You arrived on Auster, the only other planet you have ever been on. It is very similar to your home planet Eo. You can't see much because the view is obstructed by all the skyscrapers.

?- talk(hardy).
Hi! Are you from Eo? Yes? So cool, I have half of my family there. My name is Hardy. I call myself an adventurer, although I have never been outside of our solar system. Well… But you know what? Maybe you will help me
 out in my escape from this galaxy? I am so hungry for travel which I cannot afford. You are really trying to build this superb spaceship? So cool!!! I can even help you! I know about the Hyperdrive schema - I was an 
engineer… Before they threw me out of my company and took all the titles. So... You need a Reinforced Steel and Electromagnetic Generator. I have one more hint for you. If you were in need of a Gold-Plated Microchip, 
you would have to go to Fates where they have a small factory of these rare components.
